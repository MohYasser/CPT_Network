# Enterprise Network Infrastructure Design & Implementation  

## Project Overview  
This project showcases the design and implementation of a **scalable, multi-segmented network** for an enterprise environment. It includes **PCs, laptops, printers, switches, routers, a server, VoIP phones, and IoT devices**, with a focus on **efficient IP management, network segmentation, and smart automation**. The infrastructure was built to optimize **network security, performance, and scalability**.  

## Key Features  
- **DHCP Configuration:** Automated IP assignment via a dedicated DHCP server.  
- **Subnetting & IP Management:** Optimized IP allocation to enhance network efficiency.  
- **DNS Services:** Configured to simulate web access within the network.  
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Isolated departments into separate VLANs for better security and traffic management.  
- **IP Dynamic Routing:** Enabled seamless communication between segmented networks.  
- **VoIP Integration:** Implemented a separate VoIP network for secure and efficient communication.  
- **IoT Smart Office Automation:** Integrated smart controls for **cameras, doors, and AC systems**, accessible via a smartphone interface.

## Setup & Configuration  
1. **Configure VLANs** for department isolation.  
2. **Set up DHCP on the server** for automatic IP assignment.  
3. **Implement subnetting** for optimized IP distribution.  
4. **Enable DNS services** to simulate internal web access.  
5. **Deploy VoIP network** with dedicated routing.  
6. **Integrate IoT devices** for smart office automation.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement **firewall rules & access control** for enhanced security.  
- Add **SIEM logging & network monitoring** for real-time security analysis.  
- Expand IoT automation for more smart functionalities.
